Scenario: Look for problems where you need to iterate through the array with two pointers, typically starting from different ends or positions within the array. 
- Consider tasks that involve comparing or manipulating elements from two different parts of the array simultaneously.
Clue: Look for problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of the array.


Simple words-la:

👉 Two Pointers technique nu sonna –
Oru array-la 2 index (pointers) use panni work panradhu.

Usually:

Oru pointer start-la irukum (left)

Innonu pointer end-la irukum (right)

Rendu peru same time-la move aagi,

elements compare pannuvanga

condition satisfy aagura pair / value theduvanga

எப்போ use pannuva?

✅ Problem-la:

“sorted array” nu mention irukum

“compare from both ends”

“find pair whose sum is X”

“remove duplicates”

“check palindrome”

nu irundha →
👉 Two Pointers use panna best

Simple Example:

Pair sum find panradhu

int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
int target = 6;

int left = 0;
int right = arr.length - 1;

while(left < right){
    int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];

    if(sum == target){
        System.out.println(arr[left] + "," + arr[right]);
        break;
    }
    else if(sum < target){
        left++;   // sum increase panna
    }
    else{
        right--; // sum decrease panna
    }
}

Easy one-line:

✅ Two Pointers = Array-oda rend side la irundhu compare panni problem solve panra technique
